# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The data fetching is confirmed to be successful, yet the FlatList remains empty.  This issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component in a React Native application is not rendering items from an API call despite receiving a successful response and valid data. The problem seems to be related to component lifecycle or rendering inconsistencies, potentially triggered by specific device conditions or timing issues.

## Steps to Reproduce

While the bug is intermittent, the steps to reproduce include running the provided code on a physical or emulated device and making multiple API calls. The empty list behavior will manifest sporadically.

## Potential Causes

- Timing Issues: Asynchronous operations in data fetching and UI updates may lead to rendering issues. 
- State Update Timing: React state updates may not be properly synchronized with rendering.
- Component Lifecycle Issues: Potential inconsistencies in the component's mount, update, or unmount cycles.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a key prop to each FlatList item and ensuring the data state is updated correctly before rendering.
